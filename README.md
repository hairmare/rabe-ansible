# RaBe Ansible

Main [Ansible](https://ansible.com) play repository for [Radio Bern RaBe](http://rabe.ch).

This repository contains the main plays used at RaBe for managing
infrastructure. It also serves as the entrypoint to all things related to
our use of Ansible.

You may find a listing of our ansible roles in the [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/radiorabe/).

Currently Ansible is in the PoC phase so you should not expect anything stable
from this repo.
